## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The observer pattern seeks to solve the problem of needing to update a webpage with information that is given to the website by the user. It seeks to solve the problem of needing to plug in one input from the user across the whole webpage. The updates need to happen as the user is making selections and the observer pattern solves these problems.


## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanisms of the observer pattern are the SUBSCRIBE method, the UNSUBSCRIBE method, and the BROADCAST method. The subscribe method adds new events to be watched for, the unsubscribe method eliminates events that do not need to be watched for, and the broadcast method itterates through all of the watched events and executes the callbacks on those events. The broadcast method is like a meeseeks box.


## Review the code generated from hte bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. Whith this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The bcw-template is a wonderful tool that I and my classmates will be able to use for our projects. The proxy objects and the observer pattern that we have learned are going to make our projects flow really really well and be very readable. These two concepts will make our webpages very interactable and live. The proxy state is what is going to take the information and data and apply it as a variable to the whole webpage. The observer pattern is going to help our code watch and update based on what listeners we provide them. These are two really cool tools that I still do not fully understand the technical functioning of but I am very grateful and hopeful that I will really get the hang of both of them.
