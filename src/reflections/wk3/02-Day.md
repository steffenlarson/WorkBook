## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

The purpose of Encapsulation is to separate data into segments, private and public, to restrict access to information but to also make a website more flexible in the data types that it can use. It is a structural method that helps developers to organize their data and functions. It makes code easier to read and easier to transition between information given.


## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Closures are a kind of built in way for Javascript to encapsulate information. They allow the functions that need the information to have access to that information while at the same time it exposes the least ammount of information to the user. It allows the user to have the information that they need to interact with the website but it hides the rest of the data and structure from the user.

The issues that the underscore prefix faced were that it depended on the user and the people reading the code to understand what it meant. Not everyone knew what a developer meant when they used the underscore prefix. This was the case when it came to many new developers. It denotes that the following function or code was private and was not intended for the user to have access to.


## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

It is a way to keep like information together. If a developer inserts a variable into a function that variable is only available inside of that function. This is a good way to keep information separate and secure from too much tampering from the user. This can also be helpful because the data set can be changing, and if developers create a variable for that data structure, it is easier to alter it down the road.
