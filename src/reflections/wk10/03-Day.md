## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are ways that developers in C# can cast types to lists and other data sets. This action helps developers type certain data as what it is for instead of what it actually is. This helps an extrordinary ammount with readability in coding.

## How can you modify an Enum?

Enums can be changed in a couple of ways. They can have their base type changed from int to something else. This depends on what the developer needs the enum for. But inside of an Enum to modify something a developer just needs to use an '='.


## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far? (If you have not yet, give an example of how you could.)

We have been using the IEnumerable a ton in our afternoon projects. This is how we can make editable lists to be instantiated before the actual controller gets built. That is how we have used Enums so far.
