## What is a List in C#?

We are utilizing the Scrum format for organizing ourselves very well. We used vue 3 to build our web application and we have been using the google maps api along with geolocation and geocoding. It has been a lot of information to come down the pipeline and it has been challenging to get used to it but we have worked really well as a team and I am proud with what we were able to make in such a short period of time.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

Everything went well. We prioritized figuring out how to work with the google api and that went well. We split into two teams for the majority of the time and we were able to tackle our project really well I think. We all made sure that everyone was kind of on the same page, and some of the technology that we used is still kind of black box magic to me, but I feel confident that if needed I could explain exactly what is going on in our project to someone on the outside.


## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

I wish we had a little more time to polish and clean our code. We never really got to a good point to refactor anything. It all works, but I wish there had been an easy fix for some of our UX problems. I also wish that we could have all sat down a little longer and gone over exactly what our code was doing.
