## What is a List in C#?

A list in C# is essentially an array. It is a type that can be manipulated like arrays can in Javascript, but for C#.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

I will be adding, deleting, instantiating, and editing lists. These are the basic CRUD methodologies and they exist in all applications in todays world. I will also be using the find methods a great deal too to utilize the edit and delete methods efficiently.


## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

I could use the List.Find method. This would return the first occurance of what the parameters are. That is how I would find and retrieve a specific item from a list.
