## Week Twelve Reflection

Today was one of the hardest days of my life. I almost gave up on myself so many times. I actually almost did not even come into class to work on my project, but I decided that I had worked hard up until that point and I wanted to give this opportunity that I was given everything that I had. I am so grateful that I did come in. I was able to pass. It was so close and today has been the hardest day of my life and easily the hardest day of the class. I was able to finally complete all of the requirements that I needed to at 4:24. I have never been more releived in my life. I had to take a long walk and I talked to my family and my fiance.

I would not have been able to complete my project if it were not for a few people. I would like to take this moment to really thank everyone who had a hand in helping me through this journey.

I want to thank my friends for always believing that I could do this. I want to thank them for supporting me and sticking by my side even though I had to get a little distant throughout this class. 

I need to thank my family for all of the love and support that they gave me. My mom Julie, my dad Dale, my sister Rebekah, and My brother and his wife Kendall and Monica. Thank you guys for believing in me and giving me the space and support that you have given me through these past five months. Thank you for all of the meals and the love and support. I could not have made it through all of this without all of you.

I also need to thank my beautiful fiance. Kyrsten, you have always believed that I could do this. It was never a question for you. You knew that I was going to succeed even when I was at my lowest points. Thank you Kyrsten. I love you with all of my heart. I cannot wait for our life together.

Finally I need to thank everyone on the Codeworks staff, without whom I would never have gotten as far as I have. You have all taught me so many things, about coding and about life. I do not know if I will ever be able to repay you all for the opportunity that you have given me through this course. I am so excited to keep pushing and to keep building on what I have been taught. I have really grown close with you guys. Thank you Harrison, Mick, Tim, Zach, Brittany, Daryl, Jake, and Mark. I am so grateful for all of the help and all of the teachings from everyone. I am so grateful for this opportunity and for the relationships that we all have been able to cultivate together.

Thank you everyone, I cannot believe that I have made it. :)
