# Day 56

## Week Twelve Reflection

This first day after coming back from the weekend was hard. I was not able to work on my project over the weekend due to my anxiety. I worked on the back end all day and I was not able to complete it like I wanted to. I did make good progress on it though and I am looking forward to finishing it in the next day or two. I regret that I did not work on it over the weekend. I know what I am doing with things, but my anxiety was just hard to manage. I anticipate getting done with the back end and all of the tests by tomorrow.
