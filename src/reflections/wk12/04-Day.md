## Week Twelve Reflection

I did not get anything done today. I struggled and struggled with everything that I tried to tackle today. I feel like I cannot do this, I feel like I am not a good developer. I feel like I am going to fail. I am so tired and frustrated and if I am being honest all I want to do is curl up into a ball and cry. I know that in the grand scheme of things that this is not the most important thing to ever happen, but it is important to me. I just want to be successful. I am really struggling today. I just want to be done.
