## Week twelve Reflection

I started work on the front end last night. I did not get as far as I wanted, but I was able to make some progress. I got the structure built out and I was able to start making the components and the home page. I feel a little overwhelmed by how much is still left and I am starting to feel like I will not be able to complete everything that I have left to complete. I still have a long way to go and I do have two whole days left. I will see where I can get on everything tonight. 
I am so stuck. I feel so frustrated with myself for not working on this project over the weekend. I feel like I am just plowing my brain into wall after wall after wall. I just want to be done and I feel like I just need someone to help me talk through things. This is so frustrating and I know that I am probably making things a bigger deal than what I need to but I feel like I am struggling. I hope that tomorrow will be better.
