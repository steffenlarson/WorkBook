## Week Twelve Reflection

I finished the back end today! All of the tests passed. I realized too that I find the back end to be straightforward. I really enjoyed getting all the tests to pass. It was such a good feeling. I felt so accomplished. I cannot wait for my project to be done, and I cannot wait to not have to stress about this deadline anymore. I have learned a lot from this project so far and I want to learn and be even more comfortable with the issues that I run into. I want to get better at using Postman to test my backend and I want to be able to read the errors that I get and I want to understand what they mean and where I need to go to get to the root of the issue I am currently on.
This project is challenging, and I am struggling still with my anxiety but I know that in the end even if I do not get everything done that everything will be ok.
