## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

Rest stands for Representational State Transfer. This means that when an API that is restful is called the server transfers a representation of the state of the requested resource to the client, or the application or person requesting it. A restful application will expose information about itself through the information about its resources. Clients should be able to take action on the resources provided, meaning they should be able to create delete and edit them.


## What does Stateless mean?

Stateless in restful applications means that the server remembers nothing about the user that submitted a request. It does not remember a thing. It also means that each individual request has all of the information that the server needs to perform the request and return a response. This is regardless of anything even other responses.


## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

The URL pattern used for writing restful API's is the HTTP pattern. The HTTP URL pattern includes four main methods and they are GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. GET gathers information, PUT edits the information, POST creates new information, and DELETE obviously deletes information.
