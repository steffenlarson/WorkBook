## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

Using exports helps organzie code. That is the biggest helping feature that using exports has. There used to be work arounds for exporting and importing code, but now with ES6 we are able to as developers directly import and export files. Exports also help protect the integrity of a webpage. The code on the page is not as directly manipulatable. The code that is imported can only be accessed if it was exported and because you are only using the code that you need when you need it, the code stays a little safer.


## What does Stateless mean?

Export default removes the need for adding * as. It can asign aliases. While using just the regular export it would be required if you were going to add an alias. Default exports are also limited to one per export, while with the regular export there is no such limit.


## What URL pattern is used when weriting a RESTful API?

The main and greatest benefit of using the Module system is how modules can assist in organizing. We can keep certain like sections of code together and it helps find bugs quicker, and as developers we will not have to spend as much time looking for problems in our code. I plan to really start using the module system once I understand it a little better.
