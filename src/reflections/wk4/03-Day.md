## What is the purpose of Async / Await?

The purpose of the async and await conventions is to fine tune the promise system of asynchronous code. Promises helped Javascript deal with many of the problems that asynchronous coding presented, but they still had their own limitations. Promises can still cause a Callback Hell. Async and await condense promises even farther. These words and the functionality tied to them makes the code look like it is synchronous when it is really asynchronous.


## What must you do in order to Await a promise inide of a function?

To use await inside of a function the function must first be declared asynchronous. Declaring before the function or assigning the function to async with the = opperator sets that function aside as an asynchronous function.


## What are some of the primary benefits of Async / Await?

The primary benefits to using the async and await method is that it makes the code shorter, easier to read, and condensed. Promises are also chained much much easier with the async and await methodology. It also allows the program or website to run other things while the function is waiting for a return of information or data.
