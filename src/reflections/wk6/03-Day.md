## What are lifecycle hooks?

Lifecycle hooks are used in Vue 3 for many things. In english a lifecycle hook allows us to peek inside and manipulate (create or update and even destroy) things in our components. They help us know when and where things are being tied in together. 


## What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks are used to manipulate and watch data. They are also used to update and manipulate the DOM. They can be used to dynamically update and render things to the DOM to make a more plesant user experience. They can help developers by watching properties and resetting the DOM everytime that the data gets updated.


## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks are used specifically when we want to on page load pull in the component. These hooks happen or occur immediately before and after the first render of a page. They help the page dynamically render as soon as the user travels to it. There is a slight delay most of the time, because there are still communications with the server that need to happen for accurate information to be displayed, but it all happens very quickly.
