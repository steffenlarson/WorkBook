## What are props?

Props are how developers pass variables and other information around between different components. They are useful for passing data from one section to another. Properties are the information. Like the name or the weight or the image. All of the data is a property.


## What are props used for?

Props are used to pass the information or key value pairs around. They can be passed around but they cannot be changed by any other element besides the parent element. Props can be used to get the information that resides in the prop onto the page.


## Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can be accessed from pretty much anywhere. They can be used as an informational tool almost anywhere too. The props cannot move up the tree, they can only move down the tree. They can only be altered inside of the parent component. Not anywhere else. Developers can use props to manipulate urls to get images and such as well.
