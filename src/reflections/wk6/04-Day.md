## What is a nested route?

A nested routes are routes that are nested inside of another page. They allow developers to make a more intricate and complicated user interfaces. They also allow components to be nested inside each other. 


## When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

An example of a time where I would use a nested route would be for a similar site to gregslist. If I wanted to have a car and vehicle website, and I was partnered with a particular brand of motorcycles, and I wanted to have a page specifically for those brand of motorcycles. I would make a nested route inside of the motorcycles page that would take the user to a page dedicated only to that particular brand. 


## Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

Because nested routes are children components to the parent page we definitely can pass and use parameters through nested routes. I would want to use parameters anytime I want to display something that comes from that original page, just in a different page or a different format. Or with more information even.
