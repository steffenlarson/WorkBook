## What is Componet based architecture?

Component based architecture is a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface (components) into self sustaining, independant micro systems. In english this means that as developers we can use this formating method to be able to section off parts of our webpages to be able to function and update on their own without having to constantly redraw the whole page. It also is conveniant to be able to have access to all of the relevant information and functionality of a certain component all in one place.


## What are some benefits of Component base architecture?

Some of the benefits to component based architecture are:
1. Components allow for the holding of all the data and methods that will be implemented or relate to a certain area of a web page. 
2. They also allow for dynamic page interaction. Meaning that the whole page will not have to be redrawn every single time something on that page gets altered. Just the one little section will.
3. Components also help maximize functionality and performance of a website.
4. Components are reusable.


## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

The main drawback to using the component based arcitecture is that overusing the principles can lead to a bloated or polluted view on the website. Meaning that the over inclusion or implementation of the component based arcitecture can make things cluttered for unnecesary reasons. It can also lead to readability issues in the code.
