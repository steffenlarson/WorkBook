## What is a virtual property?

Virtual properties are extra information that can be requested through the model. These values cannot be edited through that same model, however it can be really nice to be able to pul more information from a specific model anytime there is a request. Virtuals do not exist on the database they only exist logically. Virtuals can also be used to help reduce work.


## When might you use a virual property?

Virtual properties can be helpful when developers are trying to take multiple parts of the data and trying to return certain information in a more readable way. Instead of needing to write a function to get something to print out a certain way every time there are ways with virtuals that allow developers to write a function once and then apply it to every instance of asking for that data.


## How do you search by a virtual properties value?

You cannot search by a virtual properties value. They are not able to be searched for or through with document queries or field selection. Only the non virtual properties can be searched through in that way.
