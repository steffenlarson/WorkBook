## What is the purpose of a Query String?

A query string allows us to pass information to and from a website by simply adding or appending that information to the end of a URL. That information is stored in the query string and it is captured when the website reads the URL. All kinds of data can be passed into any request using query strings. the data once passed can be captured in node from the request object and this data can be used and manipulated any way that we as developers desire.


## What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

Query parameters arrive as a key=value pair. The query string part of a URL begins right after the '?' (Question Mark) and in between each individual parameter (key/value pair) there is an & (ampersand).


## When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

When writing my servers I believe that the query parameters will be most helpful with distinguishing and stating where a request needs to go. This is like which doorway the knight needs to look for and enter. If the request has a item that says that its looking for a certain place to go, this is how the query parameters will be helpful. It will be most helpful in determining what the request was looking for.
