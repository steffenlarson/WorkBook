## Week Five Reflection

This week was a little easier because we did not have a checkpoint to worry about. I am sad this week to see the seniors go. The server side is really interesting to me and I hope that I can learn it a little better. The hackathon was fun and I learned a lot about working with a team and how I need to do a little better about working with whoever I am paired up with. I really struggled with my partner on our team. This week was really interesting and I need to do a little better about studying during the week and I am making a goal to spend an hour each night on classwork. Then I can stay caught up on the readings and journals and I will be able to make sure that I can have them all done before the weekend so that I am not scrambling to get those and my checkpoints done. I love the class and while it is really challenging and really frustrating at times I am enjoying the struggles that I am facing while I am learning how to code. 

Thank you to all of the staff at BoiseCodeworks. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my time spent there. :)
