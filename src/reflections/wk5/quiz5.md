**1.** What do the letters of the acronym `CRUD` stand for?

```
The acronym 'CRUD' stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are all of the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These are the methods of communicating with a server from the client and also communicating between the server and the dadabase.
```
**2.** Each action that `CRUD` represents maps to an HTTP request. What HTTP request does each `CRUD` action correspond to?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Create corresponds with POST. Read corresponds with GET. Update corresponds with PUT. Finally Delete corresponds with DELETE. It's not DESTROY, go figure.

The first blank should be: SYNCHRONOUS. The second: ASYNCHRONOUS. It will then read:

-In a synchronous coding model, when you call a function, it returns only when the action has finished and stops your program for the time the action takes. Likewise in an asynchronous coding model, multiple things are allowed to happen at one time. When you perform an action, your program continues to run.
