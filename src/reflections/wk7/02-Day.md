## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Code Documentation is a way for developers to further describe their code so that when they and their colleagues look at it or look back to it they all know a little easier what is going on and how it is working. The naming of variables can be helpful in this but there is a built in way for developers to document their code. It is called JSDoc. It has its own syntax and it is just adding comments and descriptions of what parameters and authors and returns are and should be.


## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

The main benefit to using Code Documentation is to help in remembering what older code does, without having to trace every single part of the application. It allows developers the chance to add a little more discription to their code without taking too much time and resources away from actually writing everything out the long hand way. It is all about sharing more information about the code. Code Documentation can also help ensure that the types of the variables or parameters are what they are supposed to be. It is another layer of protection and redundancies.


## How important is Code Documentation and why?

Code Documentation can be very important. While it does have its drawbacks like taking time to write and constantly having to be updated alongside the code, the information that it can provide to the whole team is enormous. Other developers will be able to catch onto what the specific code is doing much quicker when Code Documentation is implemented insied of our code.
