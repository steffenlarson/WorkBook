# Day 34
__01/28/2021__

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

The principles that my group and I implemented the most this week were the buddy coding. We did really well to all sit around one computer and we all worked really well together. We also wrote a couple of notes on our code so that we could know what was going on as we look back on some of the things that we did. We also thought a little bit about the user experience, but unfortunately we did not have enough time to really drill into that.


## What went well?

All three of us were really able to get as much out of things as we could. Justin was a huge help and he was really good at driving our team onward. Chris and I helped by talking through the different problems that we encountered and we were all able to make a very functional, if not super pretty, website project. 


## What would you do differently?

I wish that we could have swapped a little more while coding. Justin did really really well making sure that Chris and I knew what was going on, but I wish that I could have been in the drivers seat to actually practice the coding a little more. I felt like I was getting dragged along a little bit, but I am sure that I was not getting dragged nearly as much as I felt like I was. I also wish that we would have made more notes in the code for what was going on. We took a lot of notes and even made a checklist for this next project. (About what steps we should take and how to do them). I also wish that we would have had more time to really start to polish it. I felt like we worked really really hard on the last two requirements that we were struggling with and that ate up a lot more time than we originally thought.
