## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

The user experience is anything that the user or customer will use or experience while on our site. Any time the user needs to interact with anything is considered part of the user experience. When developing the user experience we should consider the user and what actions that they will be taking on our site. We will also want to know what we want them to feel, and we want the process of accessing the website to be as easy and painless as possible for the user. 


## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

The largest benefit by far of creating a good user experience and considering the user before we just plug away at what we need to accomplish is the ability to get people to feel what we want them to feel. We also want the user to stay on the site as often and as long as possible. Taking the time to create a good UX can make or break a website. The whole process really depends on the users for their contributions.


## Why is the User Experience important?

For many websites the user experience is vital. Most websites are built for buying and selling things, there is almost always a monetary trade going on at some point. Having a good user experience is important in web design just like having a good customer service manner is valuable and important in retail or food. The more that you can cater to good customers and users and the more that they customers want to stay around on the website which makes it more likely that they will spend money on your site.
