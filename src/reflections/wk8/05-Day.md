## Week Eight Reflection

This week was really great. It started out stressful with the two strike checkpoint, but I was able to make it through that. I am sad to see another fellow student go, but if anything it has made me even more determined to finish the course. I want to stay strong and I want everyone at Boise Code works and in my life to be proud of what I have accomplished. I cannot wait to see what the final looks like so I can tackle that challenge and meet it head on. I have really started to enjoy all of my time spent in class. I know that I take a minute to grasp all of the concepts but I have really come so very far. I do not want to let myself and everyone else down. 

Thank you Brittany for always being willing to talk and thank you for being willing to listen to what I have to say.

Thank you Mark for being a good teacher. Thank you for taking the time to help me learn and understand things on my own and with help.


I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Codeworks staff and family. Thank you everyone for all the help and support while I go through this journy along side you all. Thank you. :)
