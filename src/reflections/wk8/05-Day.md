## Week Eight Reflection

This week was really really good. Despite some of the drama that happened in school, my partners and I were able to stay on task. I hope that this weekend I will be able to pass this project. I am really really anxious about it. I know that if I need help that I can reach out, but I am still finding it challenging to ask for help sometimes because I feel really dumb with some of the questions that I have.

I would like to reitterate what I have said before and say thank you. Thank you to all of the staff at BoiseCodeworks. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my time spent there. Especially after this week. :)
