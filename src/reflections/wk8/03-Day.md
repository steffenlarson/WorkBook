## What is Software Developement Testing?

Software Developement testing is testing the code that gets written as it gets written. There are ways that developers can write code that will run each small piece of code to see if that individual piece is doing what it should be doing in different circumstances.

## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

There are many benefits to doing unit testing:
1- Testing gives peace of mind about the code being written.
2- Testing makes a developer condfidant about what is going on and how to fix problems that might arise later.
3- Testing helps with efficiency, because if a develper tests as he codes potential problems with the code can be identified before it goes off to be officially tested.
4- Testing helps with Documentation. As long as the tests are well written. The tests also have to be maintained as often as the code is, where comments can simply and often do get ignored.
5- Testing can lead to overall better design of a website and of the code within it.


## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

Some drawbacks to testing in software developement are:
1- It can be expensive.
2- It can be seen as a waste of time.
3- The tests would have to be rewritten every time there is an update to the code that they belong to.
