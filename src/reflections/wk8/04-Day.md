## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? what does each method provide?

The three main types of testing are unit testing, component testing, and end to end testing. Unit testing tests each smallest unit at a time. Component testing provides the most Vue-friendly integration possible when testing. End to end testing tests the whole application in one go and this provides the closest user experience.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I personally beleive that the most useful testing method is going to be the unit testing. I believe this because if we as developers can write out our tests as we begin coding, we can become better developers. If we can learn to anticipate what is going to happen or what could happen, we will be better suited to solve coding problems when they occur.


## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I believe that the least useful testing method is the end to end method. It does have its uses, and it probably looks really good on paper, but to put off the testing of something until the very end seems foolish to me. I believe that it still has a place in the coding world, but it should be reserved as a safety check more than anything. It takes a long time for the end to end tests to go through all the pieces that make up a whole application, and that time is money.
