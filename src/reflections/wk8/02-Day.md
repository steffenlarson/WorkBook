## Why is communication on a small team important?

Communication overall is vital to any fully functioning and good working team. In smaller teams it is even more important because there are less people to pull slack from other places. Everyone needs to know exactly what everyone else is doing or going to be doing so nothing gets missed in a project. Communicating is vital to any kind of team based project. Too much time spent on communication however can draw time away from productivity time.

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

There are a couple of differences when using Scrum in a small team. There is still the same ammount of work to be done if there were more people. People need to buy in and be willing to strech themselves to fit what the project needs. Also making sure that everyone is still on the same exact page remains important, but with more to do by fewer people, the time needs to be managed well. An increase in communication on a less formal level can help keep the client and other people right outside of the team informed while also allowing the team to stay on the same page and keep working.

## What is the unattainable triangle? what are the tradeoffs of each side?

The unattainable triangle has three sides:

1- Good service cheap will not be fast,
2- Good service fast will not be cheap,
3- Fast service cheap will not be good.

This means that the whole project is a balancing act. A team that is able to say exactly what the expectations are and that knows where the client can be flexible and unflexible with is key to making the MVP work. Finding a happy medium where all parties are happy and getting what they want is key with the unattainable triangle.
