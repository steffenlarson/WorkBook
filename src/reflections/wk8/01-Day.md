## What functiondoes a developer Porfolio provide?

Pair Programming is the concept and practice of two developers or programmers sharing a workspace. They use one computer one mouse and one keyboard. The idea is that the two programmers can fulfill two roles: the driver and the navigator. One person actually typing the code, and the other guiding where the driver goes or should go next. An open dialogue is necessary for this practice to be the most effective.

## What makes a developer Portfolio effective?

Some of the benefits of Pair Programming are:
1. An increase to code quality.
2. A better 'shared knowledge' among the whole team and partners.
3. A better and more effective way for more experienced team members to train and teach the less experienced ones.
4. A reduction to the coordination of the whole team by cutting the number of individual projects by half.
5. An improved resistance to disruptions in the coding process. If a team member needs to step out or redirect their attention for any reason, the partner can catch them up once the first returns.


## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

The main problems with Pair Programming are:
1. Both members of the pair must be active and engaged in the work. Otherwise there is no benefit.
2. When poorly applied, the worst case scenario is that it doubles the cost for no benefits.
3. An open dialogue is required. If there is no speaking and thinking out loud there is less benefit to the practice.
4. This practice is not fruitful among people that do not work well together. It cannot be forced upon people. The people participating need to be able to work together, otherwise there is no point in forcing the two together.
