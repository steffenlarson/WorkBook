## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A pseudo class is used to define a special state of an element. When used in CSS it can affect how certain elements respond to certain stimuli. For example a common pseudo class in hover. This pseudo class helps a website be more interactable and helps add some nice class to the web pabe. I see myself using this pseudo class a great deal in my future.


## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a rule that is built into CSS that helps determine which rule should be applied if there are multiple rules that are effecting the same element. This rule assigns values to each part of the class to help it determine what rule takes precedence over another. This can greatly affect how a web page looks.


## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The biggest problem with the !important feature is that it puts everything onto the same level of specificity. If everything is tagged with !important, it will be challenging or impossible to override certain classes or aspects of my code. I personally am going to do my best to never have to use the !important tag.
