## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My Favorite tip that will be the most beneficial to me is a tie between using color and weight to create a heirarchy and using shadows and borders to add space. I beleive that I reach for changing the size very quickly whenever I am designing something and I feel like there are better, more subtle ways of accomplishing the same effects. With the borders and shadows I do not want to become too comfortable with any one way of creating space. Being able to be flexible with the tools that I have access to leads to good designs.


## Compile a couple of resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examplles of good design ideas.

The two resources that I have chosen because I think that they will be helpful are the Material Design Guidlines and my own knowledge of art. I was an art student for a time while I still attended college and I really do enjoy the aspects of design so far in this course. The Material Design Guidlines also look very interesting in my breif time looking into them.


## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a wevsite and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Design is such a powerful tool. There are so many different things that you can convey through color and spacing and design. Emotions, feelings, ideas are some of the most powerful things in our human experience and design can help us as designers convey exactly what we want the audience of our content to know.
