## What is the purpose of wire-framing?

The purpose of wire framing is to sketch out and plan a website. This is helpful not only to identify potential problems early, but it is also extremely helpful when talking and planning with groups of people. Wire framing gives people an image and therefore a much better idea of what is going to be created and how all of the elements of the page will fit together.


## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

There are three levels of wire framing and they are low, mid, and high. Low tier wire frames are useful in conveying the base idea the quickest. They are also the cheapest to create both in time and money. Low tier wire frames do not even have to use a digital format. All that is needed is an idea and pen and paper. Mid tier Wireframes typically do use a digital platform, and they include more details and information and convey the final products look and ideas better than a low tier wirefram. The final tier is high. With a high tier wireframe the most details about the webpage are given. The actual pictures and sizes of fonts and everything are used and allow for the exploration of more complicated and intricate concepts of a page.


## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they requre? Why ore Why not?

Wire frames are most definately worth the time, energy, and effort that they require. Wire frames will help to keep a developer on task and allow those developers to think with all of their brain power on the tasks at hand, instead of focusing on remembering everything all at once.

Wireframes will help convey what is possible from a design aspect and the biggest help that wire frames offer is that they save time and money. They allow developers to not have to backtrack and fix too many problems. Wire frames allow developers to get concepts and ideas translated correctly in the first place.
