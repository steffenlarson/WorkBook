## Week Eleven Reflection

This week has been hard leading up to getting the final. I was ready to hear about what it was when we fisrt started class on monday. I am really glad that we have it now and I hope that I can manage my time well and I cannot wait to get it done. I am very anxious about how things are going to go this week and I hope that I can do it. I know I can do it. I just need to take this project one step at a time. Do one thing that I know how to do and then move onto the next thing in the line. I cannot wait to make this a great project. 

Thank you to everyone on the Codeworks staff. I appreciate all that you guys have done for me.
