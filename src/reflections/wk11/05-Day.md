## Week Eleven Reflection

This week flew by. I cannot wait to get the final project. I hope that it all goes well. I feel like I know a lot, I just like to have help. I cannot wait to pass this class. I am so proud of myself for coming this far. I cannot wait to see what is at the end of this tunnel. I am so proud of the skills that I have been able to cultivate with the help of all of the staff at Boise Codeworks. Thank you to all of those memebers of the staff that have been so helpful and friendly. I will truly miss everything about the course.
