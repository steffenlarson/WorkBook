## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

The three categories of data types are:

1- Value Types
2- Reference Types
3- Pointer Types

Value types simply hold their value always. Reference types hold an address of where the data is. Finally Pointer types point to other methods and data.


## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from Javascript?

There are many value type data types. They are:
Bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort.
The main difference that I notice from C# and Javascript is that there are many more classification types in C# than in Javascript. They all have different puproses that make them useful, and I cannot wait to learn how to use them all effectively.


## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?  

Reference types get stored in memory in a different way than Value types. The local memory part stores the address of where all of the data is stored, and methods that utilize a reference type are then allowed to go retrieve the whole collection that is needed. Value types always have a value, while reference types can be null, until they are instantiated.
