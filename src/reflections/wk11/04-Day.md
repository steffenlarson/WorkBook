# Day 54
__02/25/2021__

## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point?

This course has been the hardest experience of my life. I have struggled throughout the course so much, but it has all been worth it. It does not always seem like that in the moment, but it is worth it. I now am much more confident in what I am doing, I am not perfect and there are so many more concepts and languages out there that I want to and need to learn and understand, but I now have a very good base knowledge that I can apply to learning more. I am very concerned about the final. It makes me sick to think that I can get kicked out of the course if I cannot complete it on time. And I am also very anxious about what comes after I am done with the course. I need to find a job so that I can pay my bills. I am worried about not using my time in the best way. I want to make the best out of this project, I just get so stressed and I worry that it may sidetrack me. All I can do is do my best and ask as many questions as I can to make sure that I get these requirements met. I am going to work really hard over the next week to get as much done on my project as possible and I am going to get graded early and often so that I can know what my actual progress is. 
I have really enjoyed everything about the course except for the pace sometimes and the pressure that I have put on myself. I also regret not always asking questions when I have them. I always feel like a bother. But I have thoroughly enjoyed learning all that we have learned so far and I cannot wait to get out and do something meaningful with this new skill that I have. And I cannot wait to continue growing in my ability to code. 
Thank you for all of your help to the Codeworks Staff. All of your time and energy and support means so much to me.
