## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

The console can be used to evaluate conditional statements, read printed messages or errors by using consol.log(), it can view data from Javascript files, and it can be used to test functions. All of these can be useful for figuring out how the code is talking to eachother. The console tab is in my opinion probably one of the most useful tabs. When testing to see if elements on the page are connected to your javascript, or seeing if a function is computing appropriately or the way that is desired are the most valuable ways to use this tab in my opinion.


## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The elements tab is the tab that is used primarily for finding and breaking down the html and css files. The most useful feature of the dev tools is that the changes that are made inside of them are applied instantly. There is another double edged sword to watch out for though. Changing anything on your page in the dev tools does not automatically save those changes in VS Code. It has more of an upside than a downside due to this interaction, but it is very good at helping developers tweak the web design quickly and efficiently.


## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

A better way of debugging code is either throwing a debugger into your code to pause the code at a certain spot or line, or inserting a breakpoint in the sources tab. This allows us as developers to go through the code line by line and really see what the interactions between different lines of code are. As developers this saves a great ammount of time and energy because we can pinpoint where the errors are occuring much much faster.
