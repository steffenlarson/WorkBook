## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan before begining to code is very helpful. The more that is known about what requirements are needed and the more that programmers can desin code around exactly what they need the better. Just starting to write the code is wasteful. Code needs to be readable and understandable and when it is not known exactly what you need a function or the code to accomplish it makes it very hard to write exactly what is needed in every situation. Not planning enough can lead to significant problems down the road of development.


## How do you find answers when you are stuck?

Google has become my best friend for finding out how to solve problems. There is the old fashioned way as well which is to ask questions. I am increasingly learning that I need to research every problem as much as possible. I need to understand exactly what is needed for every problem before I start asking questions. I am learning that I need to be very comfortable with learning forever. It is a little daunting, but it makes sense. I also want to start thinking about criticism in a more productive and healthy way.


## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

My biggest take away from this article is that I need to be ok with learning every day of my life. I need to keep my code clean and understandable. I need to do things right the first time as much as possible, and I need to be willing and able to communicate effectively and willigly. I have many many sources open to me and I need to be comfortable using and finding the best ways to do things. I need to become an ever-innovator. I hope that I can really go through a significant change while taking this course. I want to become the best programmer and writer of code that I can become. It is going to take a ton of work and energy, but in my opinion it will be well worth the work and time invested. Especially with the Boise Codeworks people at my side.
