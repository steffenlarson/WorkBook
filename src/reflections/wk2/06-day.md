## What is Scope?

Git is a distributed version control system meaning that it is a program that stores content. The stored content is tracked and records are made from any changes that are applied to the code. The code can be accessed and changed by multiple developers even at the same time and run paralelly. There are local and remote repositories of the information. The local repositories are stored locally on the developers computer, and the remote repositories are stored on a server.

## What is Hoisting?

Having multiple branches in Git allows for multiple developers to simultaneously work on a project. The branches come together when the code is pushed to Github, and all of the changes can be compared and looked at. From that point Github allows the overwriting and progress of the code to be updated, while still keeping a cache of steps and changes that the code has gone through. 

## In what cases would you use LET vs. CONST vs. VAR?

The difference between Git and Github is that Git runs independently on every developers computer, while Github is a website or forum for the code and project to be pushed to to be stored and to be able to see the progress. Github allows developers to share their own progress to eachother without having to be in the same room. Git is what stores and processes the code on the individual developers desktop or laptop.
