## Week Two Reflection

I have really struggled this week. Most of my struggling has come from this weekend. I did not manage my time effectively, and I think that due to the fast pace of the course I am struggling and I need to work on asking for more help. I have made some big strides this week in asking questions and in not feeling like I am just bothering people. I stuck my neck out a couple of times too when I did not quite understand something and asking a question at those times has helped me learn quite a few things. I want to be successful in this course, I am willing to put the work in, I have just struggled with my depression this weekend. I can do a little better and I think that everyday after class I need to spend time in my code working on journals, and working to understand the concepts that we are learning even more. 
I love being a part of Boise Codeworks and I hope that I can continue to do well and I hope that I can have the resolve and confidence to not give up on myself prematurely. Functions are hard, and I have made a lot of connections this week, I hope I can keep adding to those connections and I hope that I can continue to understand more and more. I want to become a coding wizard. 
The difference between arguements and parameters really threw me for a loop this past week. I think I understand them better now though.
