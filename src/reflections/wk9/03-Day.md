## What are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

There are many ways that the Scrum method will change for smaller teams. Because a smaller team has fewer resources, and therefore fewer resources to manage, less time can be spent on making sure that everyone is on the same page. Everyone still needs to be on the same page, but it will be more important than ever for all of the staff and everyone involved in a project communicate to the best of their abilities. 

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time?

Scrum prescribes one sprint at a time usually because everyone is working on making a marketable and functioning project at the end of each sprint. With a smaller team it is more challenging to have all aspects of the project being worked on all at the same time, therefore some flexibility needs to be practiced when using the Scrum guidelines.


## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

The unnatainable triangle is a philosophy that says:

Good service cheap will not be fast
Good service fast will not be cheap
fast service cheap will not be good

This is a good philosophy that teaches balance. Everyone (the team, the client, the bosses) needs to be as up to date and aware of how everything is going to add up and change. Communication at the onset and at the earliest possible moment when issues arise is key when thinking about this unattainable triangle.
