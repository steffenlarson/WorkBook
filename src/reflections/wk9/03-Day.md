## What are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

The main function that a developer portfolio provides is to showcase what a particular developer has worked on. It is a fantastic way for employers to see what exactly you have done well. It is the best way to showcase yourself as a developer and an amazing way to show off particular skills in action.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time?

Being able to show a potential employer what you have done well as a developer is key to landing a job. The nice thing with a portfolio is that you can tailor what you put into it to the specific audience that you are targeting if you wish.


## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose dows it have in Scrum?

I would like to include Justin and my partner project, and I would like to add the bug collector project. I need to polish them up quite a bit first, but I also would like to include our capstone project which still needs a name... These projects are some of the more advanced ones that we have had and I would love to see them polished more and they really show everything that I have learned in the course so far.
