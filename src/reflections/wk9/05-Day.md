## Week Nine Reflection

This week flew by. Spending all of our time on our Capstone was really fun and rewarding. We had help but we really built an app from the ground up. I am so grateful that I was able to work with Nathan, Kris, and Justin so closely. They are all great developers and they have helped me learn a ton this last week. We had a lot of fun and got a lot of practice in which is extremely nice with the final project coming up. I want to pass this course now more than ever. I cannot wait to get to the other side and I really cannot wait to start working with a team. I want to learn as much from everyone that I can. I love making things work and function. I cannot wait to start really polishing some of my old projects. 

This journey has been a roller coaster for sure, and it is not quite done yet, but I am so grateful that i took this opportunity to get to know everyone at Boise Codeworks. I am so grateful for everything that I have been able to learn and I cannot wait to be a part of the alumni and I cannot wait to share and teach as many people and students as I can in the future. This course is insanely hard and challenging, but it has all been worth it.


I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of the Codeworks staff and family. Thank you everyone for all the help and support while I go through this journy along side you all. Thank you. :) Thank you, thank you, thank you to all of the Codeworks Staff! You guys are so amazing and great!
