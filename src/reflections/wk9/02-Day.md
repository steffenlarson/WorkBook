## What is a Github action and how do they work?

GitHub Actions are tools that allow developers to better control their repositories in GitHub. They work by writing a workflow. There is a maximum of 20 workflows that are allowed for one project, but each workflow can have multiple jobs or code to run to check on things on certain actions. 

## What benefits do Github actions provide?

There are many benefits that GitHub actions provide. The first is that it allows a developer to set up a system where on a push to the master branch of a project an action can check to see if the build is working before it gets deployed live. There are other things too it can give people pulling your repositories more information too and give the owner more information as well.


## What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

Anything that changes the repository. Like a push, a pull request, or a fork. Any of these trigger actions are available for a workflow to use. The trigger actions simply change the repository or access it in some way. There are other events that can use these actions too. Scheduled, webhooks, and external. All provide the user and the owner of the repository more actions for actions taken to the repository.
