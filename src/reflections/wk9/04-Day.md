## What is an SSL certificate?

An SSL certificate is a way for websites to become more secure. A website with an SSL certificate will have access to encryption. The SSL essentially binds the browser to the server and encrypts all of the data so that the data stays private from all parties except the user and the server. 

## What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

There are many different certificates. They are separated into two groups. Encryption/ Validation certificates or Domain number. There are essentially several tiers of certs too. Ranging from the ones that are the most expensive but protect the most, to the ones that protect less, but are either cheaper or free. Then also the number of domains that the certificate is used for applies to the organization of the different kinds of certs. There are: 

EV certificates
OV certificates
DV certificates
Wildcard certificates
UCC certificates


## What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

The main and biggest benefit that comes with using SSL certificates is that it makes your website secure. It helps protect against malicious ware being used on your site. SSL certificates show users that there are methods and checks in place for your website so that they can trust sharing their sensitive information with your site and buy or use your services.
